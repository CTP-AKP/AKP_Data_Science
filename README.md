## Project Outline:
Our data consists of descriptions, and a collection of over 83,000 games on the Steam platform. Current recommendation models use collaborative and/or content-based approaches. We use Large Language Models (LLM) and Langchain to make our recommendations.

## Practical Application:
This project utilizes new and emerging technologies, to provide new insights for users to find games to play. Typical recommendation algorithms provide users with recommendations based off of similar developers and themes, while this technology can be combined alongside the same criteria, including descriptions of the game. Our application also allows users to directly query a LLM, with

### 1.0 Overall Concept:
Depending on our final datasets, we will extract and compare the various variables, such as Genre, Developer, Release Date, and compare with variables commonly used to measure success for video games. This would be Total Sales, Region Sales, Ratings and more. Then, we will use this data to develop a model to determine if a game would be successful based on user input and idea.
