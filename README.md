# Predictive Analysis and Feature Importance of Successful Video Games

## Team Details:
**Team:** KAP Team  
**Members:**
- Artem Guz
- Kevin Dsouza
- Peter Wong

## Overview:
**Framework:** streamlit  

**Objective:**  
To analyze various video game datasets to determine the characteristics of successful games and develop a Machine Learning model that can predict the success of a video game based on its features, primarily focusing on Genre.

**Datasets:**  
- Popular Video Games
- Video Games Data
- Best Year for Video Games

## Project Outline:
Depending on our final datasets, we will extract and compare the various variables, such as Genre, Developer, Release Date, and compare with variables commonly used to measure success for video games. This would be Total Sales, Region Sales, Ratings and more. Then, we will use this data to develop a model to determine if a game would be successful based on user input and idea.

## Practical Application:
This project can provide valuable insights to game developers by highlighting the features and genres that are most likely to yield successful games, allowing them to make more informed decisions during the game development process.
